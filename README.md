# SOFAIR - Sensor Observations to FAIR data

![SOFAIR logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/geosas/sofair/main/docs/images/sofair-logo.png)

The SOFAIR project is an interoperable middleware designed to promote and develop the OGC SensorThings standard.  It takes the form of an OGC API-compliant service integrating various functions to simplify, automate and guide the FAIRisation of temporal data. The processes are :
* Creation of a new SensorThings instance,
* Methods for configuring this instance,
* Various functions to automate or simplify the supply of data to the service,
* Connecting this service to Spatial Data Infrastructures (SDI) in terms of metadata and geographic layers,
* Automatic generation of permalinks to viewers for displaying data from this service in cartographic or time-based portals.
*
